# AI Interviewer

Practice technical interviews out loud. An AI interviewer asks role-specific questions in a natural voice, listens to your spoken answers, scores each one, and writes a final report with strengths, gaps and topics to study.

## Features

- **Voice in, voice out.** Questions are spoken with Groq's Orpheus voice. Answers are recorded in the browser and transcribed by Groq Whisper, so it works in any modern browser and not only Chrome.
- **Never goes silent.** If Groq text-to-speech is unavailable (free-tier quota, rate limit, outage), the app switches to the browser's built-in voice automatically.
- **Adaptive questions.** `openai/gpt-oss-120b` on Groq writes each next question based on the role, the difficulty and what was already asked, with strict JSON outputs.
- **Per-answer scoring.** Every answer gets overall, technical-accuracy and communication scores, plus strengths, weaknesses and feedback.
- **Final report and history.** Each interview ends with a holistic assessment and study topics. Completed interviews are saved to your dashboard.
- **Accounts.** Email and password sign-in, with optional Google sign-in. JWTs are kept in httpOnly cookies.
- **Interview integrity.** Fullscreen mode plus tab-switch and focus-loss detection, with automatic disqualification after 3 violations.
- **Resilient sessions.** Live interviews are stored in Postgres, so a server restart or redeploy doesn't lose progress.
